QtEdge
======

A Qt-based gui for configuring n2n edge nodes.  QtEdge is fully compatible with Linux and Windows because Qt and n2n are awesome like that.

QtEdge is designed around n2n 1.3, and may not be fully functional with 2.x.  2.x support is planned for shortly after when n2n 2.x receives a stable release, or when I get bored enough.

**n2n is not included and must be downloaded seperately.**
 * **Linux:** n2n should be in the package manager of most Linux distributions.
 * **Windows:** A windows-based build can be found here: http://luca.ntop.org/n2nWin32/binary/
 * **Source:** n2n's source code can be obtained from their subversion repository: https://svn.ntop.org/svn/ntop/trunk/n2n

If you inspect QtEdge's source code, you will discover just how shoddily this is coded.  I made it in a day while half-asleep and barely knowing how Qt and n2n work, with the intention of getting it in a usable state as fast as possible.  There are no comments and the code style is inconsistent.  That being said, the program works as-is with no known issues, probably by virtue of being so simple and Qt making things so easy.
